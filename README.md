# Library for GRPC implementation

What is in this library?

1. Proto contracts of GRPC services
2. Prost based autogenerated grpc contracts
3. Grpc server abstractions
4. Grpc client abstractions

How to add new grpc contract?

1. Create new feature in Cargo.toml
2. Create new proto contract in proto-files
3. Import your contract on lib.rs inside ./src
```rust,no_run
#[cfg(feature = "your feature name")]
pub mod your_namespace_grpc {
    tonic::include_proto!("position_manager_persistence");
}
```
4. Create new release tag.
5. Add this library to your project dependencies. (Don't forget to activate your feature and add correct tag version)
6. Done. You can get access to your contacts. 

```rust,no_run
fn main() {
    grpc_contracts::your_contracts_grpc::YourGrpcModel
}
```
